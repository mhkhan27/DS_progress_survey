# #Meeting title: achievement of solutions
# 1. Very few HHs achieved a solution (passed 5 IASC criteria).
        # a. What were the main drivers of preventing this achievement/progress towards solutions?
# 2. Existing analysis shows the cities with the lowest index scores (Daynile, Kahda, Xudur) also have very high preferences to return.
        # [From previous anlysis] a. We know in many cases conflict IDPs are more likely to want to return home.
        # [Done] b. Is there a relationship/correlation between poor conditions and high return preferences?
        # [Done] c. Is there a relationship between duration in displacement and high return preferences?
        # [Done] d. How do these vary geographically?
# 3. Think of any other key indicators that could stimulate interesting discussion with SRP

# [] a. We know in many cases conflict IDPs are more likely to want to return home.



# a. What were the main drivers of preventing this achievement/progress towards solutions?

Main drivers are
  1. Access to living standard [IDP - 58%; HC - 88% If the access to electricity can be improved  and reduced tthe barries  for IDP then we can improve ]
  2. Access to livelihood [IDP -27%, HC - 48% - FOCUS - access to financial institutaion and avg income must be improved]
  3. Access to documentation [IDP - 9%, HC- 32%- Legal indentity ]
